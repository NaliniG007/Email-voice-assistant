## Abstract
- In recent years, voice assistant has shown significant process  and  its potential is growing. And billions of devices that incorporates them in domestic nowadays. Then, to communicate with one another, Email is one of the most prevalent way.  In this paper,  we are  targeting  to  establish  an  AI  based  email  voice  assistant  system. The voice assistant listens to the user's voice input and converts it as a text and then sends it as an email message to the recipient. Firstly, we have to provide user’s email id and its Gmail account’s password to authenticate and this can be executed using Python in PyCharm community IDE. SMTP is  the most  common  and  popular  protocol  of  email  which  means  Simple  Mail  Transfer  Protocol . It  is used  for  transmitting  email  from  one  account  to  other  over  the  internet. Protocol  means a  list  of  instructions  that  validate  and  manage  the  transfer  of  email   and  also it  pushes the message  from  client  to  the  server.  MTA ( Message Transfer Agents ) is the client  which  should  be present  in  the  system  to  send  and  receive  mail.

## Technologies Used
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing


## Existing System
- Email servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither their users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect, typically to a mail server or a webmail interface to send or receive messages or download it. The users send text messages only by typing or forwarding.


## Proposed System
- The proposed model make use of SMTP library and packages like pyttx3, pyaudio, speech recognition and microphone. 
- User has to give voice command to the email voice assistant. He has to denote the specific recipient (Email ID) which he already implemented in the assistant. The assistant then asks about the subject and body of the email. After giving the content of email, the email voice assistant sends the message to that recipient.
- This model involves Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning techniques.
